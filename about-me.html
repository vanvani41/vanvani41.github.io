    <h1> Introduce of Myself...</h1>
    <p>Hello! I am vanvani41, my real name is John, i am playing CS2, Standoff 2, Beat Saber, Gorilla Tag, Roblox, and other games, also i was playing osu! Right now i am playing ONLY Beat Saber (everytime at home), and Standoff 2 (sometimes at home, and everytime with a friend or friends at school)</p>
    <h1>Some more info about me...</h1>
    <p>I live in Ukraine at Kyivska Oblast', hearing shacheds, bombs, and other, also, there is no electricity in Kyivska Oblast' because Russia keeps bombing not only cities, and also generations, generators of DTEK, and other, maybe Ukr/OblEnegro too(</p>
    <h1>My Last Beat Saber Stats...</h1>
    <p>Last time when i was playing Beat Saber, i got better at every skill: Tech, Speed, Acc, and instead of 8th place of Ukraine and top ~#2500 in Global, now i am on 6th place and top #2300 on Global and this is on leaderboard called BeatLeader, and now it's the same as on another leaderboard called ScoreSaber, and soon i will be 5th on Ukraine and on top ~#2200 on BeatLeader but not on ScoreSaber, you will ask why? Because i am playing on Quest 3, so i am playing beat saber standalone, and ScoreSaber didn't made the mod for the version of the game that i am playing on (the latest one, 1.40.8).</p>
